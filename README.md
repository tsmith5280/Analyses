# Analyses
# Data Lab

Welcome to my sandbox of practical and cryptic data analyses — from job market patterns to horror movie tropes, psychological game metadata, and beyond.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for Pandas and PySpark workflows
- `results/`: Charts, summary tables, and exportable results
- `requirements.txt`: All necessary packages

## Analysis Workflow

Each project typically includes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Pandas
2. **Parallel PySpark implementation** for scalability
3. **Transformations**: groupBy, joins, and window functions
4. **Output**: Cleaned results and/or visual summaries

## Planned Projects

| Project | Dataset | Highlights |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `horror-trends` | Horror Movie DB | Genre evolution, budget-to-rating correlation |
| `netflix-vs-imdb` | Netflix + IMDb | Join, rank, filter by region |
| `pokemon-battle-stats` | Pokémon Base Stats | Type matchups, winrate simulation |
